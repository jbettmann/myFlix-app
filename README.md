## Description

This is the server side component of the "myFlix" web application that provides users with access to information about
different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up,
update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
The database requires authentication and authorization using basic HTTP authentication and JWT (token-based) authentication.
